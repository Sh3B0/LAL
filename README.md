Linear Algebra Library (LAL) is a C++ library that intends to allow fast and easy computation for common tasks with matrices, vectors, fractions, graphs and complex numbers.  
Codes are intended to be as simple as possible and to simulate the manual computation with steps when necessary  
Project is under development and is made for education, training and fun.
